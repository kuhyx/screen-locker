"""Pre-commit hook: ban silent failures.

A caught exception that is swallowed (not re-raised) must say WHY in the log,
loudly. Otherwise the failure is invisible: the caller sees a bland ``None`` /
``[]`` / early return and cannot tell "nothing to do" from "it broke". That is
not hypothetical — the PC's workout sync silently did nothing for weeks because
a missing token returned ``[]`` and a real error only logged at ``INFO``.

The rule: every ``except`` handler must either

* re-``raise`` (the failure is someone else's problem), or
* log at ``warning`` / ``error`` / ``exception`` / ``critical`` with the reason.

``debug`` / ``info`` do not count — an invisible log is a silent failure with
extra steps. ruff's ``S110`` only catches ``except: pass``; this catches the
far more common ``except: log.info(...); return []``.

There is deliberately no escape hatch (per-line lint suppressions are banned
repo-wide too): if a failure is truly benign, say so at ``warning`` and move on.
